## User Story #1
### Description ###
In this user story the basic structure of the website was implemented. The page displays course data from an JSON file. The table adapts to the screen size and changes it`s look on mobile devices. The print button, which is always visible at the bottom right of the screen, can be used to print the table or save it as a PDF file. Only the table is printed.
