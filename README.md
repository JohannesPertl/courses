## Purpose

There are two main goals of this project. 

1. Learn how to create a basic website using Javascript, CSS and Node.js  
2. Learn how to develop in a team, by following the agile process framework **Scrum**

This is accomplished by implementing a *Course Management System* in three sprints and responding to change requests from the product owner.

## Sprint 01

### Userstory 01 - List Overview

The basic structur of the website is implemented. The course data, that is saved in a .json file, is displayed in a table. This table is responsive and also works on mobile devices.  
With a print button on the bottom of the screen, the page can be printed or saved as a pdf file. Only important information gets printed.


### Userstory 02 - Search

In this userstory, a fast and responsive search function is implemented. 
While inputting text into a search field, only courses containing matching text are shown. The matching text is highlighted as well.
