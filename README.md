## Purpose

There are two main goals of this project. 

1. Learn how to create a basic website using Javascript, CSS and Node.js  
2. Learn how to develop in a team, by following the agile process framework **Scrum**

This is accomplished by implementing a *Course Management System* in three sprints and responding to change requests from the product owner.

## Sprint 01

#### Userstory 01 - LIST OVERVIEW

The basic structur of the website is implemented. The course data, that is saved in a .json file, is displayed in a table. This table is responsive and also works on mobile devices.  
With a print button on the bottom of the screen, the page can be printed or saved as a pdf file. Only important information gets printed.


#### Userstory 02 - SEARCH

In this userstory, a fast and responsive search function is implemented. 
While inputting text into a search field, only courses containing matching text are shown. The matching text is highlighted as well.


## Sprint 02

#### Userstory 03 - INSERT COURSE

By clicking an insert button, the user is redirected to a new page. There they can add a new course to the table by filling out a form. 


#### Userstory 04 - CHANGE COURSE

By clicking an edit button belonging to a specific course, the user is redirected to a new page similar to the one in userstory 03,
where they can change the individual compoments of the course. 

## Sprint 03

#### Userstory 05 - INPUT VALIDATION

The data added or changed in userstories 03 and 04 are now validated in real time. If the data is invalid - e.g, a duplicate or in a wrong format - the user gets visual feedback and suitable error messages.


#### Userstory 06 - REMOVE COURSE

A new button for each course provides the functionality to delete it. To avoid accidental deletion, a pop-up message warns the user and asks for confirmation.


#### Userstory 07 - EXPORT DATA

Two new buttons at the top of the page make it possible to export the courses as PDF or CSV file.
